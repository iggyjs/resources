# Resources
If this repository has a central concern, it's to provide an index for all of the online resources that have taught me something about the way the web works. The only real determiners for inclusion are:
1. Did the knowledge stick with me?
2. Was it easy to read?
3. Did it shift my mental model of the web in a meaningful way?

Each resource will have a tag for which of the three above criteria apply.
